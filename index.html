  <h1>Overview</h1>

  <p>
    The UK High School Integration Bee is a national mathematics competition
    designed to challenge students in Year 12–13 (and other interested students)
    to think creatively and logically using A-level integration. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Round 1 is hosted in schools across the UK as a one-hour multiple-choice
    paper. The top-performing students qualify for the national final, where
    participants compete in a round-robin format and then knockout rounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    This competition encourages problem-solving, logical thinking, and
    mathematical insight. It’s a great opportunity to challenge yourself
    and compete with students from across the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participation in the Integration Bee is not only fun but also looks
    excellent on university applications and helps develop important
    problem-solving skills.
